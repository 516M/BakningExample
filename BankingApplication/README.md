# What is this?

This is a tiny Banking application I've written in Java, using the Idea IDE.
The concept is to have an 'application' where you can manage your account, and an 'ATM' where you can withdraw or deposit money.

## Goals of the project

Here are some of the things I implemented/plan to implement in this application:
(These are subject to change)

- More information to the Bank Account of the person, i.e. a 'Bank number', an 'ID', the 'type' of the account, etc.
- ~~Add reading/writing to file functionality. This will be in plaintext.~~(TODO: Writing to file must be done in order! ~~Also, passing filename by command-line arguments.)~~
- The main banking application: login interface with password, as well as 'admin tools' so that you can see all the accounts, print all of their details, etc.
- ~~An ATM 'Application'; The difference being that you can actually withdraw/deposit (physically, let's assume here)~~ (TODO: add limit of amount of withdrawable money)

(TODO: More to come here)
