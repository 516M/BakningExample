# Banking Application in Java

This is a tiny Banking application I've written in Java, using the Idea IDE.

## Goals of the project

Here are some of the things I implemented/plan to implement in this application:
(These are subject to change)

- More information to the Bank Account of the person, i.e. a 'Bank number', an 'ID', the 'type' of the account, etc.
- Add reading/writing to file functionality. This will be in plaintext.
- A login interface with password, as well as 'admin tools' so that you can see all the accounts, print all of their details, etc.

(TODO: More to come here)
